			<br>

	  	<p>
	  		Hello.  My name is Ben Schaefer and like you I am an exclusive agent with Allstate.  My family has been
				involved with Allstate for over 40 years and I want to keep it going for another 40 years.  Allstate can 
				make it tough on us though.  Whether it is new company guidelines, rate changes, underwriting issues, 
				or those new IPS counts, we are constantly facing new challenges.  I created Exclusive Agent Marketing 
				to find solutions to some issues that I was facing and that many other agents around the country are 
				facing.  As an agent you know what kinds of things we have to deal with on a day to day basis.  We 
				encounter enough stress throughout the week and I wanted to start something that can help take away 
				some of that stress and help us all grow together.

	  	<h2>Main problem the company wants to resolve</h2>

	  	<p>
	  		With all of the changes that go on there are two things that always stay constant.  New business and retention.

	  	<h2>How the company help clients solve that problem</h2>

	  	<br>

	  	<p>The first thing we address is retention and customer service.  We all know that retention is a key part to
			growing our books.  All of the effort we put into gaining those customers we obviously want to keep 
			them around.  Now we cannot control rates but we can do our best to make them happy otherwise.  A 
			happy customer hopefully means we get a good customer survey and as we all know if we get enough of 
			those it means an extra 1% bump in pay.  I believe I have created something that can help our customer 
			service which will increase retention and at the same time protect us from any E&amp;O exposure all at the 
			fraction of the cost of what it would take for an employee to do this.  What is that exactly, well we will 
			call each of your clients 1 month before they renew to set up a yearly review.  If they want to accept the 
			review they will be routed to your office to set up a time to do that review.  If they decline we will 
			document that and you will get the report at the end of each month stating who declined the review.  
			We will also keep a record of the reports in case you happen to misplace it and need it at a given time.  
			This could come in handy in case a customer tries to file an E&amp;O on you.  We will also call each one of 
			your customers around the time their surveys come to them.  If for some reason they are unhappy and 
			cannot give you a favorable review on your survey we give them the option to speak to you first before 
			they fill out the survey to hopefully work it out.  Do you want to welcome all of your new customers 
			each month well we can do that for you as well.  Was there a big storm that came through your area 
			recently and you want to reach out to each of your customers well we can do that for you.  These are all 
			things that can help get your voice out there to your customers to let them know you care.</p>

			<p>The second thing we address is new business.  Now we have all tried leads before and probably like you I 
			am sick of wasting my money away on leads that are sold to 10 other competing agents.  Not to mention 
			these “leads” are probably going to be shopping around each and every year because they are never 
			happy with the rates.  Those aren’t the customers we want.  I wanted to find a way to generate my own 
			leads and have them call us directly.  I created a new lead system where the leads call your office and 
			are waiting for the quote.  They aren’t sold to other agents.  They aren’t web generated leads.  These 
			are warm transfer leads organically produced by us.  When you pick up the phone they will be there 
			waiting for you to quote them.  No more we will waste time and money buying web leads and then 
			paying staff to call them and hopefully if we are lucky speak to them.</p>
